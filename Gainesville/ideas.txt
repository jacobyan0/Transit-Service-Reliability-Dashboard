try to connect people to shelter from heat

IMPORTANT IDEAS:
    - shelter != protection from heat, only protection from sun
    - on certain days, when heat index is particularly high, humidity + heat = better to stay indoors
        shelter outside wont help
    - vs UV, protection from sun damage is a different thing
plant trees + shelter
different colors/warning to let users know what kind of heat they are dealing with
an information section -> how to deal with heat + sun
    sunscreen
    drink water
    eat a good meal, etc

how to find out where most heat exposure is felt?
useful data: what general neighborhoods or populations of people suffer the worst of heat illnesses
    we can assume owning a car means you generally are safer from heat exposure?

1. public information  
    what counts as a cooling facility -> like a park with trees, does a walmart count?
    places that are easily accessible and provide people with shade, a place to rest
    important to consider the homeless
    calling 211 provides info 
    on certain very hot days, there are locations where officials are apparently giving out water
    cooling center -> public location, public restrooms, should have sources of water, should be free to enter, should let you sit 
        alachua county public library
        community centers
            clarence r. kelly center
            eastside community center
            mlk center
    website may keep track of whether these locations are open

2. heat exposure measurement tool
    uv exposure for the day, heat level, humidity
    ideas: 
        - let user enter their own information
        "How sensitive am i"
        gives personalized feedback on whether you should travel on this day/at this time, or stay at home
    I am 22 years old, female, 140 lb, 5'8 i plan to traavel march 15 2-5 pm 
        - tips: bring water, if the trip includes more than 30 min of walking, take a rest, wear sunscreen
    

3. crowdsourcing
    feedback reports, let users leave comments, etc
